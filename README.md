Our App Containes One Web App (Client) and 2 Backends(server & spring_boot_server ) and two mobile app (flutter_app and react_native)
Main Apps Are Client, Server and Flutter_app Other apps we build because we want to do this assignment by using many frameworks.

We didn't remove other projects or create a new repository because we need to show our commit history.

To test Web app first go to the client folder and open terminal type and enter <h1>npm i --save</h1> after dependencies install you can start app by type npm start.

And To start our server go to the server folder and type <h1>npm i --save </h1> to install node-ts <h1>npm install -g typescript ts-node </h1> after all done type npm start now server will start

Start flutter app open project in vs-code and press f5 it will open ( To do that you need to install flutter and android studio in your computer)
